Made this group project for Programming and data structure course for Sem2. Lots of things went wrong and I was a bit skeptical if we would be able to put everything together and make it work but it went smooth. Our demo, we killed it. We had lots of code so we played on that. We gave a quick run thorugh to our code what is happening and all. And then we answered their questions regarding weight changes, k-means etc etc. We gave them the demo. They asked if we could run and show them the weight changes on Swipes and Cluster changes based on the swipes. they gave us 5-10 mins for that, and we did it. I guess ours was the best presentation.
